# Data formats {#head}

**CSV** stands for comma-seperated values. Records are listed separated by a single comma. It is a file format with which, for example, tables can be easily saved and exported. CSV files can be recognized by the extension ".csv".

You can also simply open and edit these files in a text editor of your choice.


**JSON** stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is also a simple data format and can be processed by all programming languages for analysis. You can recognize JSON files by the extension ".json". You can also open and edit JSON files in all text editors.
It serves, mainly in web applications, the transfer of data.

For illustration you can download data sets in both formats and compare the results.

**TIDY**** is of the same format as a CSV file and has the same extension(.csv).
Data which often occur in CSV files in a disordered manner are arranged in Tidy data in such a way that each variable, for example the BoxId in the context of the SenseBox, the name of the box or a phenomenon, forms a series and each observation forms a line.
