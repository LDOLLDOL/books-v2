# DIY-Umweltstation {#head}

<div class="description">In this project you will learn how to set up a senseBox environmental station. In the end, the measurement of various environmental phenomena such as temperature, humidity, brightness and air pressure, as well as the publication of the data on the  <a href="https://opensensemap.org">openSenseMap</a>  be possible!</div>

## Introduction

This project is the most extensive. It has been split into several subchapters. In each new chapter, an additional module is introduced until a complete - the functions similar to the senseBox: home - weather station was built!

Within this project you will find the following 5 chapters:

* [Temperature and humidity](temp_luft.md)
* [Experiments with light](licht.md)
* [UV-Sensor](UV_Sensor.md)
* [air pressure](luftdruck.md)
* [Data upload to the OSeM](datenupload.md)

You can edit the stations as individual projects, or expand your program code with each station to measure all five phenomena simultaneously.

**Good luck building your DIY Environmental Station!**
