  Attention! <br>
  The openSenseMap is a portal where people worldwide upload measurement data of their senseBoxes or other measuring stations. These data are used by individuals, but also by <b>researchers, for scientific purposes</b>. You should therefore only register the senseBox:edu on the oSeM if you want to upload data in the longer term and present these real environmental measurements and are not falsified for experimental purposes. If you still want to register your senseBox: edu, you simply have to enter it as senseBox:home-v2.
