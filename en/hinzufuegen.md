## Possibility #1

You delete your old station and register a new `senseBox` and directly select the sensors you want to add. You can delete your old station by selecting `Delete senseBox` in the `Dashboard` after entering your password. **Remember that this method will delete all previous readings!**

## Possibility #2

You create a new `senseBox` with the desired sensors and get the correct sketch sent to you. There you only have to edit your `WiFi` or `Ethernet` settings and exchange the ID's for the sensors. 

## Possibility #3

You select `Edit` in the dashboard for your station and change to the tab `Sensors`. There you put your desired sensors and get two new `SensorID's`. With these new SensorID's you can now edit your sketch 'manually'. If you don't know how to do this, you can find help in our instructions in the [edu Books](https://sensebox.github.io/books-v2/edu/de/index.html?Deutsch=English).
